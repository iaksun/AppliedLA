 ## Applied Linear Algebra for everyone

**Linear Algebra** has been a topic for math savvy students and taught only in Science and Engineering programs since its beginning in 1600's. However, in today's world, data is everywhere and **everyone** (especially young generations) needs to understand how to work on data; social sciences, administrative sciences, medicine, law have all been inundated with data and data-centric approaches. It is only natural that the data relevant to the field would make sense to the people trained in that specific field much better than they would do to science and engineering majors.

It is the intention of this project to help students, professionals, researchers in these fields to be literate in data manipulations using the tools from Linear Algebra, which are widely used in all data processing tools. Here are a few topics that many can relate to: solutions of large systems of linear equations, least-square data fitting, classification, compression, clustering, visualization, etc. 

This is a project to develop a course on Applications of Linear Algebra for Everyone with the following features:

* it uses Julia programming language with Pluto notebook as the teaching and application environment; 

* it does not require any prerequisite to follow and learn the materials, just enough motivation and perseverance would suffice; 

* the lecture notebooks on Pluto will include single line codes (occasionally a few lines would be needed), markdown texts and necessary equations (not many); 

* it mainly emphasizes concepts, intuitions with many examples and applications rather than math foundations of the methods;

* for curious and math oriented people, and for some who are willing to invest in a little more, there will be brief intros and a few handworked examples of some methods that are considered to be important and fundamental for the understanding and building intuitions of the concepts;

## Inspiration

There are few giants today in the field of Linear Algebra and they have been inspiring many students and professionals worldwide. Here I would like to name a few who have inspired me to embark on this project:

* First and foremost, **_Prof. William Gilbert Strang_** from MIT, whose lectures on Linear Algebra, talks on the importance of Linear Algebra for everyone (written a book titled ``Linear Algebra for everyone``) and assessment of linear algebra to be simpler and more accessible than Calculus, all on youtube, encouraged me to design a series of lectures on the topic. 

* Then, I have come across the lectures of **_Prof. Stephen P. Boyd_** from Stanford University on _Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra_ on youtube and the [webpage] (https://stanford.edu/class/engr108) of the course. These not only have encouraged my resolve further on the project but also provided great resources to build the course around, including the textbook [_Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra â€“ Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares_] (https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/) by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe (thanks to them and the publisher _Cambridge University Press_ for making the book available on-line). 

I am hoping that the lectures would serve the purpose and
