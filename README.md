 ## Applied Linear Algebra for everyone

**Linear Algebra** has been a topic for math-savvy students and taught only in Science and Engineering programs since its foundation in 1600's. However, in today's world, data is everywhere and methods from Linear Algebra help decipher the underlying story of data in every field. That is, social sciences, administrative sciences, medicine, law, in addition to engineering and sciences, have all been inundated with data and data-centric approaches. Therefore, it is only natural that the processed data by the methods of linear algebra would make sense to the people trained in the specific field of the data much better.  Consequently, those who are trained in any field, that is **everyone**, need to understand the tools, as well as their working principles, in order to work on and make sense out of the pre-processed and processed data.

It is the intention of this project to help students, professionals and researchers in these fields to be literate in data manipulations using the tools from Linear Algebra, which are widely used in all data processing tools. Here are a few topics that many can relate to: solutions of large systems of linear equations, least-square data fitting, classification, compression, clustering, visualization, etc. 

This is a project to develop a course on **_Applications of Linear Algebra for Everyone_** with the following features:

* it uses the Julia programming language with Pluto notebook as the teaching and application environment; 

* it does not require any prerequisite to follow and learn the materials, just enough motivation and perseverance would suffice; 

* the lecture notebooks on Pluto will include single line codes (occasionally a few lines would be needed), markdown texts and necessary equations (not many); 

* it mainly emphasizes the concepts and intuitions with many examples and applications rather than math foundations of the methods;

* for curious and math oriented people, and for some who are willing to invest a little more, there will be brief intros and a few handworked examples of some methods that are considered to be important and fundamental for the understanding and building intuitions of the concepts.

## Inspiration

There are few giants who have taught courses (mostly shared their courses online) and written excellent books on Linear Algebra have been inspiring many students and professionals worldwide. Here I would like to name a few who have inspired me to embark on this project:

* First and foremost, **_Prof. William Gilbert Strang_** from MIT, whose lectures on Linear Algebra, talks on the importance of Linear Algebra for everyone (written a book titled ``Linear Algebra for Everyone``) and assessment of linear algebra to be simpler and more accessible than Calculus, all on YouTube, encouraged me to design a series of lectures on the topic. 

* Then, I have come across the lectures of **_Prof. Stephen P. Boyd_** from Stanford University on _Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra_ on youtube and the webpage (https://stanford.edu/class/engr108) of the course. These not only have strengthened my resolve further on the project but also provided great resources to build the course around, including the textbook ``Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra â€“ Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares`` (https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/) by **_Stephen Boyd_ and _Lieven Vandenberghe_** (thanks to them and the publisher _Cambridge University Press_ for making the book available online), ``Julia Language Companion`` (https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls-julia-companion.pdf) and lecture slides. 

* Seeing the first two great examples with ample resources and much needed motivation on the topic was enough for me to decide on the project and on the use of the Julia programming language, but I was not so sure how to deliver the lectures; debating on the use of powerpoint slides in conjunction with the Jyputer notebook. However, once I have encountered the great lectures on _Introduction to Computational Thinking_ by  **_Profs. Alan Edelman, David P. Sanders & Charles E. Leiserson_** from MIT, delivered online on the Pluto notebook, I have been so impressed on the delivery of the lectures and the power of the Pluto notebook that I immediately decided to use the Pluto notebook environment in my lectures. 

## Acknowledgement

As I have stated above, I have been inspired by the three exceptional groups with their talents of teaching and selfless approach of sharing their materials that they have painstakingly developed. Here, I would like to give due cerdits to those, including these three groups, from whom I have  

* learnt some of the materials, and/or 
* used their shared materials in the forms of datasets, Julia codes, Pluto notebooks in my lectures and 
* got some help in setting up the paltforms that has made my life a lot easier 

during the development stage of this course.

Please note that I will do my best to include the references in my lecture notes wherever they are due, but I will try to give their credits on this opening page as well. So, this page is intended to keep growing while I am developing the lectures, and hoping that there will be many other references and contributors along the way.
